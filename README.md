# Gender-Classification

<p align="center"><project-description></p>

## Summary
Social media has become increasingly popular over recent years providing an abundance of unstructured data to be mined and analyzed.  Using this data can allow for a better understanding of society and thus improving social interactions.  Twitter is a popular and free social forum that allows members to create microblogs, referred to as ‚Äútweets‚Äù.[1]  The human mind is complex, and analysis of tweets can provide insight to various behavior patterns of individuals.  Communication has changed vastly over the years due to the increase in technology, thus deeming it imperative to better the understanding of human interaction in modern times.

## Problem Statement
There are endless benefits to data mining and analyzing social media, specifically ‚Äútweets‚Äù.  Making sense of common words can allow for improved marketing, understanding the relationship between users and various topics, and improved interaction in society.  It is important to keep the focus of analysis on social media specific to epistemology, rather than exploitation and purposes of greed.[

## Future Updates
As a nonbinary gender option is a recent implementation in the US, in the future, I plan to further explore gender classification with the addition of a nonbinary category.
